Welcome to my web page. Here, you will find a description of my past and
current research (full list below), as well as pictures of mathematical
objects and some notes on simulations.

## Research

I am a *directeur de recherche* at the *Institut Fourier* in Grenoble, and a member of the probability team. My main research interest is in statistical physics, especially the study of critical phenomena in two dimensions. I spent most of the academic years 2013-2015 in Bonn, Germany (at the Max-Planck Institut and then the Hausdorff Center), and was previously at the École Normale Supérieure in Lyon.

## Images and simulations

During my PhD and since then, I produced quite a few pictures of various two-
dimensional objects, especially of SLE processes. Some of them can be found
[here](pictures.html), and a few comments about the programs used to generate
them are gathered [here](simulations.html) (I am planning to set up separate
pages for a few of the programs, which will be linked from there as well).
