title: Pictures
---

Here are some pictures I produced of various random two-dimensional objects. In
each case there is a small preview, and the full-resolution image itself is
linked in case you would like to download it (some of the files can be quite
large!). There is a discussion about some of the simulations themselves on [this page](simulations), and if I get the motivation someday I might set up separate pages for each model.

**“Terms of use:”** You can use any one of the images on this page in any
way you see fit; just let me know when you do so.

One last thing: If you need pictures with a higher definition (or
pictures of something else that I did not put here but might have
simulated already), just ask!
